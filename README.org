* GCMH - the Garbage Collector Magic Hack

  Enforce a sneaky Garbage Collection strategy to minimize GC interference with
  the activity.

  During normal use a high GC threshold is set.

  When idling GC is immediately triggered and a low threshold is set.

  A more detailed explanation of the rationale behind this can be found at:

  [[http://akrl.sdf.org/]]

  - WARNING

    In case Emacs is used in a system already under severe memory pressure
    be sure to understand how GCMH works and trim ~gcmh-high-cons-threshold~
    accordingly. Default value may be to big and/or GCMH may not fit your use
    case.

** Usage

   Add into your .emacs

   #+BEGIN_SRC
(add-to-list 'load-path "path-to-gcmh-here")
(require 'gcmh)
(gcmh-mode 1)
   #+END_SRC

   If this is done at the beginning of your .emacs start-up time should
   also benefit form it.
